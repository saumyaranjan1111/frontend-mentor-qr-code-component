## My process
- Created a basic skeleton of the website using HTML
- Created a div for the card which contained the image of the qr code and the card-title and card-paragraph
- Used padding and margins to give it the desired look
- Resized the image to fit into the card div and also resized the card title and description divs to fit proportionally with the image.
- Gave a background image and centered it and gave it type cover so it covers the whole screen.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I hope to focus on learning more of flexbox and grid so I can be more comfortable with using them in my projects.
I will try to use custom css as less as possible for the positioning of divs and delve more into the grid, and flexbox ways of doing the same things.


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me learning about different css components and styling techniques. I really enjoyed their visual examples and they made it easy for me to understand different concepts.
